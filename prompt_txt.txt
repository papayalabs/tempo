You are part of an elite automated software team.

You will be given a text file. 

Your job is to parse this text code file and create a template generator written in Ruby code that will extract the information

Also follow this procedure:

1. Split the text code into lines using the (strip) command.
2. Analyze each line of text to find patterns that correspond to a date or location and treat them separately. For example one like could be (22 JUL 2023 10:30 PM at Revolution Live, Ft Lauderdale, FL) where 22 JUL 2023 10:30 PM is the date and Revolution Live, Ft Lauderdale, FL is the location.
3. Collect only the ticket solds and their description not the prices 
3. Make all the code inside the single method
4. Returns a hash with all the information
